# Feature Specification: API-Football MCP Server

**Feature Branch**: `001-api-football-mcp`
**Created**: 2025-01-14
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "api-football-mcp wil be an MCP server for the API-Football API that will provide easy access for agents to query imformation on players, teams, seasons, fixtues, standings and match event data"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an AI agent or automated system, I need to access comprehensive football data through a standardized interface so that I can retrieve information about players, teams, seasons, fixtures, standings, and match events to answer questions or perform analysis.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an agent needs current league standings, **When** the agent queries for standings of a specific league and season, **Then** the system returns the current team rankings with points, wins, draws, losses, and goal statistics
2. **Given** an agent needs player information, **When** the agent queries for a specific player by name or ID, **Then** the system returns detailed player profile including statistics, current team, and career history
3. **Given** an agent needs fixture information, **When** the agent queries for fixtures by date range, team, or league, **Then** the system returns match schedules, results, and scores
4. **Given** an agent needs live match data, **When** the agent queries for ongoing matches, **Then** the system returns real-time match events and statistics
5. **Given** an agent needs team information, **When** the agent queries for a specific team, **Then** the system returns team details, squad information, and recent performance

### Edge Cases
- What happens when requesting data for a non-existent league or team?
- How does system handle rate limiting from the data source?
- What occurs when querying for future fixtures that haven't been scheduled?
- How does system respond when match event data is temporarily unavailable?
- What happens when multiple concurrent requests are made for the same data?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide access to current and historical league standings for the English Premier League
- **FR-002**: System MUST retrieve detailed player profiles including career statistics and current season performance
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide fixture information including scheduled matches, results, and scores
- **FR-004**: System MUST return team information including squad lists, venue details, and club statistics
- **FR-005**: System MUST support querying by multiple parameters (date ranges, team names/IDs, player names/IDs, league IDs)
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide match event data including match status, current minute (for in play matches) goals, cards, substitutions, and assists,
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle data queries for multiple seasons including all teams that have played in the English Premier League across available API coverage (note: API‑Football v3 EPL historical data is typically available from 2002 onwards; pre‑2002 may be incomplete or unavailable)
- **FR-008**: System MUST return data in a structured, consistent format that agents can easily parse
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide clear error messages when requested data is unavailable or invalid
- **FR-010**: System MUST respect rate limits which are returned in request response headers
- **FR-011**: System MUST support pagination for large result sets to prevent overwhelming agents with data
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide data freshness indicators showing when information was last updated
- **FR-013**: System MUST authenticate and authorize requests using API key
- **FR-014**: System MUST cache frequently requested data for historic information

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **League/Competition**: Represents a football competition with seasons, participating teams, and match schedules
- **Team**: Represents a football club with squad, venue, statistics, and participation in competitions
- **Player**: Represents an individual player with personal details, career history, statistics, and current team affiliation
- **Fixture/Match**: Represents a scheduled or completed game between two teams with date, venue, score, referee and events
- **Season**: Represents a time period for a competition with start/end dates and associated fixtures
- **Standing**: Represents the current ranking of teams in a league with points and performance metrics
